Simply install this app and for any product that has accessory products configured on the product they will be
automatically shown/selectable in the shop.
You can configure this on the product form:

Here's what happens when the customer clicks on the "Add to cart" of the suggested accessory:
- If the product itself is already in the basket we only add the accessory,<br/
- If the product and the accessory are not in the basket we add one of each,<br/>
- If the accessory is already in the basket we no longer show it
